# Kf.Core
**Basic .Net helper classes, because I hate writing code twice.**
Kf (KodeFoxx) Core holds a set of .Net classes and objects that speeds up, at least, my development. It's meant to be lightweight and if a new feature is considered, it should be considered again before actually adding it here.

Some things...
- **Conventions** are enforced to be used throughout the project. They are documented in code and in the tests.
- **Extension Methods** should always be under the root namespace of "Kf", they are collected in the "(extensions)" project folder.
- **Helpers** are usually base classes that hold functionality to make extension methods work. At least for now this is 100% the case.
