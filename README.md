# Kf.Core
Basic .Net helper classes, because I hate writing code twice.

Kf (KodeFoxx) Core holds a set of .Net classes and objects that speeds up, at least, my development. It's meant to be lightweight and if a new feature is considered, it should be considered again before actually adding it here.

Some rules
- *Conventions* are enforced to be used throughout the project. They are documented in code.
- *Extension Methods* should always be under the root namespace of "Kf", they are collected in the "Extensions" project folder.
